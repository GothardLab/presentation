conditions to show--> the conditions which you want to show
	to show all cnds,	"conditions to show: all" (just type "all")
	to show a range of cnds,"conditions to show: 05-->08" (type the start trial, an arrow, and the end trial)
	to show specific cnds,	"conditions to show: [03 08 09]"

condition order--> how the conditions will be presented
	to show in random order,"condition order: random"
	to show incrementally in the order provided, "condition order: incremental"
		default order is incremental

trial retry--> immediate, delayed, ignore
	if the monkey gets an error retry that trial immediately, "trial retry: immediate"
